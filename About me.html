        Bangladeshi food is a delightful explosion of flavors, centered around rice, lentils, 
        and a variety of curries made from fish, meat, and vegetables. Signature dishes like 
        Hilsa fish in mustard sauce, biryani, and street foods like fuchka showcase the rich 
        culinary tradition. Each meal ends on a sweet note with treats like mishti doi, 
        making every bite a celebration of taste and culture.
